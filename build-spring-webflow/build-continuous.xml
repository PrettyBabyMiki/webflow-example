  =======================================================================
  Build file containing targets for continuously integrating build
  Targets are put in a separate build file to prevent users from
  having to put in an SSH library in ANT_HOME/lib
  
  This build requires an SSH client to be put in ANT_HOME/lib. Refer
  to Ant's SCP documentation for more information.
