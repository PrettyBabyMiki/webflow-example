This is where the master build that creates releases of Spring Web Flow resides.  The build system is based on spring-build, which is linked in using an SVN external to https://src.springframework.org/svn/spring-build.

USERS
- To build all Spring Web Flow projects, including samples:

    1. From this directory, run:
       ant
        
Build Pre-requisites:
- javac 1.5 or > must be in your system path

Building Behind a Firewall:
- If you are building behind a proxy and are having connection problems, update the ../spring-build/lib/ivy/jets3t.properties file.
  For more information about the configuration properties see http://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/toolkit/configuration.html#jets3t
