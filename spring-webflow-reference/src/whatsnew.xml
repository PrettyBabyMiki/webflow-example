			<title>Embedding A Flow On A Page</title>
			<para>
				By default Web Flow does a client-side redirect upon entering every view state.
				That makes it impossible to embed a flow on a page or within a modal dialog and execute more than one view state without causing a full-page refresh. 
				Web Flow now supports launching a flow in "embedded" mode.
				In this mode a flow can transition to other view states without a client-side redirect during Ajax requests.
				See <xref linkend="spring-mvc-embedded-flow"/> and <xref linkend="spring-faces-embedded-mode"/>.

		<sect2 id="whatsnew-jsr303">
			<title>Support For JSR-303 Bean Validation</title>
			<para>
				Support for the JSR-303 Bean Validation API is now available building on equivalent support available in Spring MVC.
				See <xref linkend="view-validate"/> for more details. 
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="whatsnew-pc-propagation">
			<title>Flow-Managed Persistence Context Propagation</title>
			<para>
				Starting with Web Flow 2.3 a flow managed <code>PersistenceContext</code> is automatically extended (propagated) to sub-flows assuming the subflow also has the feature enabled as well.
				See <xref linkend="flow-managed-persistence-propagation"/>.
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="whatsnew-portlet-resource-requests">
			<title>Portlet 2.0 Resource Requests</title>
			<para>
				Support for Portlet 2.0 resource requests has now been added enabling Ajax requests with partial rendering.
				URLs for such requests can be prepared with the <code>&lt;portlet:resourceURL&gt;</code> tag in JSP pages.
				Server-side processing is similar to a combined an action and a render requests but combined in a single request.
				Unlike a render request, the response from a resource request includes content from the target portlet only. 
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="whatsnew-conversation-manager">
			<title>Custom ConversationManager</title>
			<para>
				The <code>&lt;flow-execution-repository&gt;</code> element now provides a conversation-manager attribute accepting a reference to a ConversationManager instance. 
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="whatsnew-redirect-in-same-state">
			<title>Redirect In Same State</title>
			<para>
		    	By default Web Flow does a client-side redirect when remaining in the same view state as long as the current request is not an Ajax request.
		    	This is useful after form validation failure.
		    	Hitting Refresh or Back won't result in browser warnings.
				Hence this behavior is usually desirable.
				However a new flow execution attribute makes it possible to disable it and that may also be necessary in some cases specific to JSF 2 applications.
				See <xref linkend="spring-faces-redirect-in-same-state"/>.

			<title>Samples</title>

				The process for building the samples included with the distribution has been simplified.
				Maven can be used to build all samples in one step.
				Eclipse settings include source code references to simplify debugging.

			<title>JSF 2 Support</title>
			<sect3>
				<title>Comprehensive JSF 2 Support</title>
				<para>
					Building on 2.1, Spring Web Flow version 2.2 adds support for core JSF 2 features 
					The following features that were not supported in 2.1 are now available: 
					partial state saving, JSF 2 resource request, handling, and JSF 2 Ajax requests. 
					At this point support for JSF 2 is considered 
					comprehensive although not covering every JSF 2 feature -- 
					excluded are mostly features that overlap with the core value Web Flow provides
					such as those relating to navigation and state management. 
				</para>
				<para>
					See <xref linkend="spring-faces-webflow-config"/> for important configuration changes.
					Note that partial state saving is only supported with Sun Mojarra 2.0.3 or later.
					It is not yet supported with Apache MyFaces. This is due to the
					fact MyFaces was not as easy to customize with regards to how component state is stored. 
					We will work with Apache MyFaces to provide this support. In the mean time you will need to use
					the <code>javax.faces.PARTIAL_STATE_SAVING</code> context parameter in <code>web.xml</code>
					to disable partial state saving with Apache MyFaces.
				</para>

				<title>Travel Sample With the PrimeFaces Components</title>
				<para>
					The main Spring Travel sample demonstrating Spring Web Flow and JSF support 
					is now built on JSF 2 and components from the PrimeFaces component library.
					Please check out the booking-faces sample in the distribution.

					Additional samples can be found at the Spring Web Flow - Prime Faces

			<title>Spring Security Facelets Tag Library</title>
			<para>
				A new Spring Security tag library is available for use with with JSF 2.0 or with JSF 1.2 Facelets views.
				It provides an &lt;authorize&gt; tag as well as several EL functions. 
				See <xref linkend="spring-faces-security-taglib"/> for more details.

				<title>Deprecated ResourcesServlet</title>
				<para>
					Starting with Spring 3.0.4, the Spring Framework includes
					a replacement for the ResourcesServlet. Please see 
					the Spring Framework documentation for details on the custom mvc namespace,
					specifically the new 
					<ulink url="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-static-resources">"resources"</ulink>
					element.

				<title>Dojo 1.5 and dojox</title>
				<para>
					The bundled custom Dojo build is upgraded to version 1.5. It now includes dojox.
				</para>
				<para>
					Note that applications are generally encouraged to prepare their own custom
					Dojo build for optimized performance depending on what parts of Dojo are
					commonly used together. For examples see the 
					<ulink url="https://src.springframework.org/svn/spring-webflow/branches/spring-webflow-2.2-maintenance/spring-js-resources/scripts/dojo">scripts</ulink>
					used by Spring Web Flow to prepare its own custom Dojo build.
				</para>
			</sect3>
			<sect3>
				<title>Two Spring JS artifacts</title>
				<para>
					The <code>spring-js</code> artifact has been split in two -- the new artifact 
					(<code>spring-js-resources</code>) contains client side resource (.js, .css, etc.) while
					the existing artifact (<code>spring-js</code>) contains server-side Java code only.
				</para>
				<para>
					Applications preparing their own custom Dojo build have an option now to
					avoid including <code>spring-js-resources</code> and put <code>Spring.js</code> and 
					<code>Spring-Dojo.js</code> directly under the root of their web application.
				</para>
			</sect3>
			<sect3>
				<title>Client resources moved into META-INF/web-resources</title>
				<para>
					Bundled client resources (.js, .css, etc.) 
					have been moved to <code>META-INF/web-resources</code> from their previous location
					under <code>META-INF</code>. This change is transparent for applications but will result
					in simpler and safer configuration when using the new resource handling
					mechanism available in Spring 3.0.4.

			<title>JFS Portlet Support</title>
			<sect3>
				<title>Portlet API 2.0 and JSF 1.2 support</title>
				<para>
					In previous versions of Spring Web Flow support for JSF Portlets relied on 
					a Portlet Bridge for JSF implementation and was considered experimental. 
					Spring Web Flow 2.2 adds support for JSF Portlets based on its own internal 
					Portlet integration targeting Portlet API 2.0 and JSF 1.2 environments.
					See <xref linkend="portlet-jsf"/> for more details.
					The Spring Web Flow Travel JSF Portlets sample has been successfully 
					tested on the Apache Pluto portal container.
