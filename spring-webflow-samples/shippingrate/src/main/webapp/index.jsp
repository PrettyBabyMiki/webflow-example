				This sample application demonstrates use of Spring Web Flow
				in combination with Ajaxian techniques.  Specfically, it illustrates a
				wizard embedded in a zone of this page that makes Ajax calls to the server to
				participate in a executing flow.  To complete processing, this wizard takes
				the details about a shipment and calls a service to get the shipping rate.
			</P>
			<P>
				The techniques demonstrated are:
			</P>
			<UL>
				<li>
					Using a JavaScript component to submit regular forms through an AJAX request, and inserting the HTML
					received from the server into a DIV tag.
				</li>
				<LI>
					Using the "_flowId" request parameter to let the view tell the web
					flow controller which flow needs to be started.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					Implementing a wizard using Spring Web Flow.
				</LI>
			</UL>
			<P>
				Note: this sample has been tested successfully on Internet Explorer 6 and 7, Firefox 2 and Safari 2.
				There are currently known Javascript issues with use on Firefox 1.5.
