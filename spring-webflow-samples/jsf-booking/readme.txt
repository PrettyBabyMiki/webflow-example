This sample is intended to demonstrate the "JSF-centric" approach to integrating JSF and Spring.  It uses the pure
JSF controller model, including JSF managed beans and navigation rules, and only utilizes Spring for the service layer.  
It is provided purely as a point of comparison against the "Spring-centric" approach of using Spring Faces and the
MVC + Web Flow controller model, as demonstrated in the "booking-faces" sample project.
