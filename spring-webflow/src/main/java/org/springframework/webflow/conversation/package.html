<p>
The conversation subsystem for beginning and ending conversations that manage the state of user interactions.
</p>
<p>
The central concept defined by this package is the
{@link org.springframework.webflow.conversation.ConversationManager}, representing
a service interface for managing conversations.
</p>
<p>
This package serves as a portable conversation management abstraction and does not depend on 
the Spring Web Flow engine. It is used by the flow execution repository subsystem to store conversation related
state. It is important to realize that this subsystem does not define a conceptual <i>conversation</i>,
it just servers as a technical layer to manage state associated with conversations, as implemented by the
SWF engine.
