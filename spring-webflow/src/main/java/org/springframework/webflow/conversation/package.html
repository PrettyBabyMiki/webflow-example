<p>
The conversation subsystem for beginning and ending conversations that manage the state of user interactions.
</p>
<p>
The central concept defined by this package is the
{@link org.springframework.webflow.conversation.ConversationManager}, representing
a service interface for managing conversations.
</p>
<p>
This package serves as a portable conversation management abstraction and does not depend on the Spring Web Flow engine.
It is used by the flow execution repository subsystem to store conversation related state.
