/**
 * A facade that provides normalized access to an external system that has called into the Spring Web Flow system.
 * <p>
 * This context object provides a normalized interface for internal web flow artifacts to use to reason on and
 * manipulate the state of an external actor calling into SWF to execute flows. It represents the context about a
 * single, <i>external</i> client request to manipulate a flow execution.
 * <p>
 * The design of this interface was inspired by JSF's own ExternalContext abstraction and shares the same name for
 * consistency. If a particular external client type does not support all methods defined by this interface, they can
 * just be implemented as returning an empty map or <code>null</code>.
