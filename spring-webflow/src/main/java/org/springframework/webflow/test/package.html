Support for testing flows and their associated artifacts.
</p>
<p>
When you want to unit test one of your flows the
{@link org.springframework.webflow.test.execution.AbstractFlowExecutionTests}
and its associated subclasses provide a base you can extend.
</p>
<p>
When unit testing flow artifacts such as actions in isolation, the
{@link org.springframework.webflow.test.MockRequestContext}
is of particular interest.
</p>
<p>
All mock implementations provided by this package are NOT intended to be used for
anything but standalone unit tests. They are simple state holders, <i>stub</i> implementations,
at least if you follow <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">Martin
Fowler's</a> reasoning. These classes are called <i>Mock</i>s to be consistent with the naming
convention in the rest of the Spring framework (e.g. MockHttpServletRequest, ...).
