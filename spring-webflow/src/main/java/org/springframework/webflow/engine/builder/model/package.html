Contains a FlowBuilder that builds {@link org.springframework.webflow.engine.Flow} instances from a
{@link org.springframework.webflow.engine.model.FlowModel}.
</p>
<p>
A FLowModel is a generic Java-based configuration model of a Flow, independent of any 
external representation such as an XML file.  Therefore, the FlowBuilder in this package may
engineer Flows from models produced from different representations.
