<p>
The FlowBuilder subsystem for building and assembling executable flow definitions.
</p>
<p>
You construct a Flow using a {@link org.springframework.webflow.engine.builder.FlowBuilder} implementation.
This is done generally by using a {@link org.springframework.webflow.engine.builder.FlowAssembler}.
This package is based on the classic GoF Builder design pattern.
