<p>
The FlowModelBuilder subsystem for building FlowModels, a configuration model for a Flow instance.
</p>
<p>
You construct a FlowModel using a {@link org.springframework.webflow.engine.model.builder.FlowModelBuilder}.
Implementations typically engineer a FlowModel from some external resource such as a file or database.
This package is based on the classic GoF Builder design pattern.
