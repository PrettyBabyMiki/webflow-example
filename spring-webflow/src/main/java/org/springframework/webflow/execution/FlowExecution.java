/**
 * A top-level instance of a flow definition that carries out definition
 * execution on behalf of a single client. Typically used to support the
 * orchestration of a web conversation.
 * <p>
 * This is the central facade interface for manipulating one runtime execution
 * of a flow definition. Implementations of this interface are the finite state
 * machine that is the heart of Spring Web Flow.
 * <p>
 * Typically, when a client wants to launch a flow execution at production time,
 * she passes the id of the governing {@link FlowDefinition flow definition} to
 * a coordinating
 * {@link org.springframework.webflow.executor.FlowExecutor#launch(String, ExternalContext) flow executor}.
 * This coordinator then typically uses a
 * {@link FlowExecutionFactory flow execution factory} to create an object
 * implementing this interface, initializing it with the requested flow
 * definition which becomes the execution's "root" or top-level flow.
 * <p>
 * After execution creation, the
 * {@link #start(MutableAttributeMap, ExternalContext) start} operation is
 * called, which causes this execution to activate a new
 * {@link FlowSession session} for its root flow definition. That session is
 * then said to become the <i>active flow</i>. An execution
 * {@link RequestContext request context} is created, the Flow's
 * {@link FlowDefinition#getStartState() start state} is entered, and the
 * request is processed.
 * <p>
 * In a distributed environment such as HTTP, after a call into this object has
 * completed and control returns to the caller, this execution object (if still
 * active) is typically saved out to a repository before the server request
 * ends. For example it might be saved out to the HttpSession, a Database, or a
 * client-side hidden form field for later restoration and manipulation. This
 * execution persistence is the responsibility of the
 * {@link org.springframework.webflow.execution.repository.FlowExecutionRepository flow execution repository}
 * subsystem.
 * <p>
 * Subsequent requests from the client to manipulate this flow execution trigger
 * restoration of this object, followed by an invocation of the
 * {@link #signalEvent(String, ExternalContext) signal event} operation. The
 * signalEvent operation resumes this execution by indicating what action the
 * user took from within the current state; for example, the user may have
 * pressed the "submit" button, or pressed "cancel". After the user
 * event is processed, control again goes back to the caller and if this
 * execution is still active, it is again saved out to the repository.
 * <p>
 * This process continues until a client event causes this flow execution to end
 * (by the root flow reaching an end state). At that time this object is no
 * longer active, and is removed from the repository and discarded.
 * <p>
 * Flow executions can have their lifecycle observed by {@link FlowExecutionListener listeners}.
