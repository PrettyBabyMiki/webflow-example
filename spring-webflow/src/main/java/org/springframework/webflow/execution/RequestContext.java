/**
 * A context for a single request to manipulate a flow execution. Allows Web Flow users to access contextual information
 * about the executing request, as well as the governing {@link #getFlowExecutionContext() active flow execution}.
 * <p>
 * The term <i>request</i> is used to describe a single call (thread) into the flow system by an external actor to
 * manipulate exactly one flow execution.
 * <p>
 * A new instance of this object is typically created when one of the core operations supported by a flow execution is
 * invoked, either <code>start</code> to launch the flow execution, <code>signalEvent</code> to resume the flow
 * execution, or <code>refresh</code> to reconstitute the flow execution's last view selection for purposes of
 * reissuing a user response.
 * <p>
 * Once created this context object is passed around throughout flow execution request processing where it may be
 * accessed and reasoned upon by SWF-internal artifacts such as states, user-implemented action code, and state
 * transition criteria.
 * <p>
 * When a call into a flow execution returns this object goes out of scope and is disposed of automatically. Thus a
 * request context is an internal artifact used within a FlowExecution: this object is not exposed to external client
 * code, e.g. a view implementation (JSP).
 * <p>
 * The {@link #getRequestScope() requestScope} property may be used as a store for arbitrary data that should exist for
 * the life of this object.
 * <p>
 * The web flow system will ensure that a RequestContext object is local to the current thread. It can be safely
 * manipulated without needing to worry about concurrent access.
 * <p>
 * Note: this request context is in no way linked to an HTTP or Portlet request. It uses the familiar "request" naming
 * convention to indicate a single call to manipulate a runtime execution of a flow definition.
