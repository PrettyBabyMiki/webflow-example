/**
 * A single, local instantiation of a {@link FlowDefinition flow definition} launched within an overall flow execution.
 * <p>
 * This object maintains all instance state including session status within exactly one governing FlowExecution, as well
 * as the current flow state. This object also acts as the local "flow scope" data model. Data in
 * {@link #getScope() flow scope} lives for the life of this object and is cleaned up automatically when this object is
 * destroyed. Destruction happens when this session enters an end state.
 * <p>
 * A flow session will go through several status changes during its lifecycle. Initially it will be
 * {@link FlowSessionStatus#CREATED} when a new execution is started.
 * <p>
 * After passing through the {@link FlowSessionStatus#STARTING} status, the flow session is activated (about to be
 * manipulated) and its status becomes {@link FlowSessionStatus#ACTIVE}. In the case of a new execution session
 * activation happens immediately after creation to put the "root flow" at the top of the stack and transition it to its
 * start state.
 * <p>
 * When control returns to the client for user think time the status is updated to {@link FlowSessionStatus#PAUSED}.
 * The flow is no longer actively processing then, as it is stored off to a repository waiting on the user to resume.
 * <p>
 * If a flow session is pushed down in the stack because a subflow is spawned, its status becomes
 * {@link FlowSessionStatus#SUSPENDED} until the subflow returns (ends) and is popped off the stack. The resuming flow
 * session then becomes active once again.
 * <p>
 * When a flow session is terminated because an EndState is reached its status becomes {@link FlowSessionStatus#ENDED},
 * which ends its life. When this happens the session is popped off the stack and discarded, and any allocated resources
 * in "flow scope" are automatically cleaned up.
 * <p>
 * Note that a flow <i>session</i> is in no way linked to an HTTP session. It just uses the familiar "session" naming
 * convention to denote a stateful object.
