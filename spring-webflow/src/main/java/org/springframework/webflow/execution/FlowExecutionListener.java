/**
 * Interface to be implemented by objects that wish to listen and respond to the
 * lifecycle of {@link FlowExecution flow executions}.
 * <p>
 * An 'observer' that is very aspect like, allowing you to insert 'cross
 * cutting' behavior at well-defined points within one or more well-defined flow
 * execution lifecycles.
 * <p>
 * For example, one custom listener may apply security checks at the flow
 * execution level, preventing a flow from starting or a state from entering if
 * the curent user does not have the necessary permissions. Another listener may
 * track flow execution navigation history to support bread crumbs. Another may
 * perform auditing, or setup and tear down connections to a transactional
 * resource.
 * <p>
 * Note that flow execution listeners are registered with a flow execution when
 * that execution is created by a {@link FlowExecutionFactory factory} or
 * restored by a
 * {@link org.springframework.webflow.execution.repository.FlowExecutionRepository}.
 * Typically a listener will not be registered with a flow execution <i>at
 * runtime</i>, when the flow execution is already active.
