		Many web applications consist of a mix of free browsing,
		where the user is allowed to navigate a web site as they please,
		and controlled navigations where the user is guided through
		a series of steps towards completion of a business goal.
	</para>
	<para>		
		Consider the typical shopping cart application.  While a user is
		shopping, she is freely browsing available products, adding her 
		favorites to her cart while skipping over others.  This is a good
		"free browsing" use case.  However, when the user decides to
		checkout, a controlled workflow begins--the checkout process.  
		Such a process represents a single user conversation that takes
		place over a series of steps, and navigation from step-to-step
		is controlled.  The entire process represents an discrete
		application transaction that must complete exactly once
		or not at all.
	</para>
	<para>
		Consider some other good examples of "controlled navigations": 
		applying for a loan, paying your taxes on-line,
		booking a trip reservation, registering an account, or
		updating a warehouse inventory.
	</para>
	<para>
		Traditional approaches to modeling and enforcing such controlled
		navigations or "flows" fall flat, and fail to express the Flow as a 
		first class concept.  Spring Web Flow (SWF) is a component of the
		Spring Framework's web stack focused on solving this problem 
		in a productive and powerful manner.

		<para>
			Spring Web Flow (SWF) is a component of the
			Spring Framework's web stack focused on the
			definition and execution of UI flow within
			a web application.
		</para>
		<para>
			The system allows you to capture a logical flow
			of your web application as a self-contained module
			that can be reused in different situations.  Such 
			a flow guides a single user through the implementation
			of a business task, and represents a single user
			<emphasis>conversation</emphasis>.
			Flows often execute across HTTP requests,
			have state, exhibit transactional characteristics,
			and may	be dynamic and/or long-running in nature.
		</para>
		<para>
			Spring Web Flow exists at a higher level of abstraction, integrating
			as a self-contained <emphasis>flow engine</emphasis> within
			base frameworks	such as Struts, Spring MVC, Portlet MVC, and JSF.
			SWF	provides you the capability to capture your
			application's UI flow explicitly in a declarative, 
			portable, and manageable fashion.  SWF is 
			a powerful controller framework based on a finite-state machine,
			fully addressing the "C" in MVC.

			Spring Web Flow has been architected as a self-contained <emphasis>flow engine</emphasis>
			with few required dependencies on third-party APIs.  All dependencies are 
			carefully managed.

			Most users will embed SWF as a component within a larger web application development
			framework, as SWF is a focused <emphasis>controller technology</emphasis> that expects a
			calling system to care for request mapping and response rendering.  In this case, those users
			will depend on a thin integration piece for their environment.  For example, those executing
			flows within a Servlet environment might use the Spring MVC integration to care for dispatching
			requests to SWF and rendering responses for SWF view selections.  Spring Web Flow ships
			convenient Spring MVC, Struts Classic, and JSF integration out of the box.

		<para>
			<note>			
				<para>
					Spring Web Flow, like Spring, is a <emphasis>layered</emphasis> framework,
					packaged in a manner that allows teams to use the parts they need and nothing else.
					For example, one team might use Spring Web Flow in a Servlet environment with Spring MVC
					and thus require the Spring MVC integration.  Another team might use SWF in a Portlet
					environment, and thus require the Portlet MVC integration.  Another team might mix and match.
					A major benefit of SWF is that it allows you to define reusable, self-contained controller 
					modules that can execute in <emphasis>any</emphasis> environment.

						As described above, some subsystem packages are optional depending on your use of the
						subsystem.  For example, use of Spring Web Flow	in a Servlet environment entails use of
						the <literal>ExternalContext</literal> context.servlet package which requires the
						Servlet API to be in the classpath.  In this case the context.portlet package is not 
						used and the Portlet API is not required.
