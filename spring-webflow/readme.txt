1. INTRODUCTION

Spring Web Flow (SWF) is a component of the Spring Framework's web stack focused on the definition
and execution of user interface (UI) flow within a web application.

The system allows you to capture a logical flow of your web application as a self-contained module
that can be reused in different situations. Such a flow guides a single user through the implementation
of a business task, and represents a single user conversation. Flows often execute across HTTP requests,
have state, exhibit transactional characteristics, and may be dynamic and/or long-running in nature.

Spring Web Flow exists at a higher level of abstraction, integrating as a self-contained flow engine
within base frameworks such as Struts, Spring MVC, Portlet MVC, and JSF. SWF provides you the
capability to capture your application's UI flow explicitly in a declarative, portable,
and manageable fashion. SWF is a powerful controller framework based on a finite-state machine,
fully addressing the "C" in MVC. 

2. RELEASE INFO

4. WHERE TO START

This distribution contains extensive documentation and sample applications illustrating the
features of Spring Web Flow.

*** A great way to get started is to review and run the sample applications, supplimenting with
reference manual material as needed.  To build deployable .war files for all samples, simply 
access the projects/spring-webflow/build-spring-webflow directory and execute the "dist" target.
See the readme.txt in that directory for more additional information.  ***

More information on deploying SWF sample applications can be found at:
	projects/spring-webflow/spring-webflow-samples/readme.txt
